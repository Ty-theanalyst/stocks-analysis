##### Stocks-analysis

## Project Overview
In this project I was asked to refactor code using Microsofts Visual Basic Application (VBA) in Excel to accumulate stock-related data based on the years of 2017 and 2018. By doing this, it would inform the reader if the certain stock would be profitable enough to invest in. Utilizing VBA, I simplified the steps in viewing the analysis by creating a button that has the ability to illustrate each stocks annual volume and return on investment.

## Purpose
The purpose of creating this visualization using VBA was to provide the reader with more of a efficient way to view several stocks at one time. A road block that rises when viewing multiple stocks at once is that time is of the essence. Refactoring the code of VBA allows for more of an expeditious completion of the analysis. 

#### Results
To produce a more efficient code, I altered the nesting order of the For Loops. I created four different arrays; tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices. These arrays allow for the For Loops to run analysis on the data being inquired about. Comparing the three arrays with the tickers array is done using the variable called the tickerIndex.

#### Summary

## Advantages and Disadvantages
Refactoring code allows for interpreting the code more feasibly, as design and structure is improved. Refactored code also gives a way for sharing and dispensing information amongst peers, more readily, for those who have a commonality of reading this type of code can do so more efficiently. This also can serves as an disadvantage. If an individual takes a functioning code and refactors is improper, there is a chance of altering the code incorrectly, causing it to no longer run.
